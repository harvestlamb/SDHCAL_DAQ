\section{Introduction to calorimeters}
\label{sec:intro}
%
Calorimeters of the CEPC detector, including electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) and hadron calorimeter (HCAL), are employed for precise energy measurements of electron, photon, tau and hadronic jets. To fully exploit the physics potential about Higgs, W, Z and related SM processes, the jet energy resolution $\sigma_{E}/E$ is required to reach 3\%-4\%, or $30\%/\sqrt{E}$ at energies below about 100~GeV. This resolution is about a factor of two smaller than the calorimeters used for the LEP detectors and currently operating calorimeters at the LHC. It significantly improves the separation of the W and Z bosons which decay into two jets, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:cal-WZ}. The basic requirements for ECAL and HCAL resolution are $16\%/\sqrt{E}$ and $50\%/\sqrt{E}$, respectively.\\

To achieve the required jet energy resolution, many R\&D researches are carried out within the CALICE collaboration since 2000~\cite{calice}. The majority of these studies aim to develop extremely fine granularity and compact imaging calorimeters with several technology options shown in Figure~\ref{fig:cal-PFA}. Imaging calorimeter is a rapidly developing novel particle detector which has excellent spatial resolution. It is capable to provide enormous position information of incident and showering particles, which makes it possible to reconstruct every single particle cluster. This is vital for Particle Flow Algorithm (PFA~\cite{cha411}) and help to significantly improve the energy resolution of hadrons. The basic idea of PFA is to distinguish charged ($\sim$65\%) and neutral particles ($\sim$35\%) inside the calorimeters. Charged particles measured in the inner tracker with high momentum resolution are matched to their energy depositions in the calorimeters. Energy depositions without matched inner tracks are considered to originate from neutral particles inside jets, among these neutral particles, about 25\% of energy from photons are measured in the ECAL with good energy resolution, while the residual energy of merely 10\% from neutral hadrons are measured by the calorimeters with poor energy resolution. Hence, the jet energy is determined by the charged track momenta of charged particles from inner tracker and energy depositions of neutral particles in the calorimeters. It has been demonstrated that significant improvement of the jet energy resolution is achievable based on MC simulations and test beam measurements. However, more efforts are needed to optimize the calorimeter design, to improve the PFA, and
to develop the technologies for high granularity imaging calorimeters.\\

The calorimeter system includes two sub-detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) which is optimized for the
measurement of photons and electrons, and a hadronic calorimeter (HCAL) which is employed to measure the energy
deposit of the hadronic showers caused by the hadronic particles when they are absorbed in the HCAL detector. The
two sub-detectors will be installed within the solenoid to minimize the inactive material in front of the calorimeters
and to reliably associate tracks to energy deposits. The calorimeter system is divided into three parts, one cylindrical
barrel and two end-caps.

The ECAL consists of layers of active sensors (such as silicon pads or pixels, or scintillator detector) interleaved
with absorber tungsten plates. The digital HCAL (DHCAL) is expected to have stainless steel absorber plates with gaseous detectors
such as glass Resistive Plate Chambers (gRPC) or GEM, or analog HCAL (AHCAL) using scintillator with SiPM readout as sensor.
Both ECAL and HCAL are sampling detectors with very fine granularity and segmentations of electronic readout
which is driven by excellent separations requirement between charged and neutral particles for the particle flow algorithms.

From Figure~\ref{fig:cal-PFA}, there are more detector options with enormous worldwide R\&D efforts ongoing within the
CALICE collaboration.
Another approach for high performance calorimeters is dual-readout calorimetry.

However, for this particular CDR, we have to be selective and focus on a few options with collaborators
who expressed great interests so far. The CEPC detectors R\&D is widely open for international
collaboration with different detector options and new ideas.

\section{Electromagnetic Calorimeter for Particle Flow Approach}
%
The particle flow paradigm has tremendous impact on the design of the electromagnetic calorimeter detector. Separating overlap showers from each other is principal requirement of the detector. A calorimeter used for particle flow thus needs to be able to do pattern recognition in the shower. The electromagnetic section has lots of tasks to fulfill. It should be able to select photons from close-by particles. It should be able to reconstruct the detailed properties of the shower, such as shower shape, starting point and energy distribution. It should be able to distinguish early starting electromagnetic showers from hadronic ones. The imaging capabilities of the calorimeter are more important than the intrinsic single particle energy resolution, although the latter is still important to the particle flow performance for electron, photons and jets. Due to the reason that about half of the hadronic showers will start development inside the electromagnetic calorimeter, a calorimeter with excellent three dimensional granularity is of utmost importance. In order to have the ability of separate close-by showers in the calorimeter, the detector with small Moliere radius is required. A large ratio between interaction length and radiation length of the detector is advantageous to the separation between electromagnetic and hadronic showers. A small radiation length will make the start of the electromagnetic shower earlier in the calorimeter, while a large interaction length will reduce the fraction of hadronic showers starting in the calorimeter. At the same time, the calorimeter with a compact structure is favorable.\\

In this section, we focus on two detector options for the ECAL, which consist of layers of active sensors (silicon pads or pixels, or scintillator detector) interleaved with absorber tungsten plates.

\section{Hadronic Calorimeter for Particle Flow Approach}
%
\subsection{Introduction}
High-granularity hadronic calorimeter concept is to play an essential role in PFA-based experiments such as
CEPC. It allows to separate the deposits of charged and neutral hadrons and to precisely measure the energy of
the neutrals. The contribution of the neutrals to the jet energy, around 10\% on average, fluctuates in a wide
range from event to event, and the accuracy of the measurement is the dominant contribution to the particle
flow resolution for jet energies up to about 100~GeV. For higher energies, the performance is dominated by
confusion, and both topological pattern recognition and energy information are important for correct track
cluster assignment. High-granularity hadronic calorimeter is thus needed to achieve excellent jet energy
resolution.

HCAL are sampling calorimeters with steel as absorber and scintillator tiles or gaseous devices with embedded
electronics for the active part. The steel was chosen due to its rigidity which allows to build self-supporting
structure without auxiliary supports (dead regions). Moreover, the moderate ratio of hadronic interaction length
($\lambda_{I}=17$~cm) to electromagnetic radiation length ($X_{0}=1.8$~cm) of iron, allows a fine longitudinal
sampling in terms of $X_{0}$ with a reasonable number of layers in $\lambda_{I}$, thus keeping the detector
volume and readout channel count small. This fine sampling is beneficial both for the measurement of the sizable
electromagnetic energy part in hadronic showers as for the topological resolution of shower substructure, needed
for particle separation.

The active detector element has very finely segmented readout pads, with $1\times1$~cm$^2$ size, for the entire
HCAL volume. Each readout pad is read out individually, so the readout channel density is approximately
$4\times10^5$/m$^3$. For the entire HCAL, with $\sim$100~m$^3$ total volume, the total number of channels will be
$4\times10^7$ which is one of the biggest challenges for the HCAL system. On the other hand, simulation suggests
that, for a calorimeter with cell sizes as small as $1\times1$~cm$^2$, a simple hit counting is already a good
energy measurement for hadrons. As a result, the readout of each channel can be greatly simplified and just
record 'hit' or 'no hit' according to a single threshold (equivalent to a '1-bit' ADC). A hadron calorimeter
with such kind of simplified readout is called a Digital Hadron Calorimeter (DHCAL). In a DHCAL, each readout
channel is used to register a 'hit', instead of measure energy deposition, as in traditional HCAL. In this
context, gas detectors (such as RPC, GEM) become excellent candidates for the active element of a DHCAL.
Another technology option is Analog Hadron Calorimeter (AHCAL) which is based on scintillator with SiPM as active sensor.


A drawing of the HCAL structure is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:441}, the barrel part is made of 5 independent and
self-supporting wheels along the beam axis. The segmentation of each wheel in 8 identical modules is directly
linked with the segmentation of the ECAL barrel. A module is made of 40 stainless steel absorber plates with
independent readout cassettes inserted between the plates. The absorber plates consist of a total of 20~mm
stainless steel: 10~mm absorber from the welded structure and 10~mm from the mechanical support of the detector
layer. Each wheel is independently supported by two rails on the inner wall of the cryostat of the magnet coil.
The cables as well the cooling pipes will be routed outside the HCAL in the space left between the outer side
of the barrel HCAL and the inner side of the cryostat.

\subsection{Semi-Digital Hadronic Calorimeter (SDHCAL)}

\subsubsection{Introduction}

For the CEPC  we propose the use of gaseous detectors for the HCAL active layers: The Glass Resistive Plate Chambers (GRPC).  This is motivated by the excellent efficiency and very good homogeneity the gaseous detectors could provide.  Another important advantage of  gaseous detectors is the possibility to have very fine lateral segmentation. Indeed, in contrast to scintillator tiles,  the lateral segmentation of gaseous devices is determined by the readout electronics and not by the detector itself.  Active layer thickness is also of importance for what concerns the CEPC hadronic calorimeter to be placed inside the magnetic field. Highly efficient gaseous detectors can indeed be built with a thickness of less than 3 mm. Other gaseous detectors could achieve such performance. However, GRPC detectors have the advantage of being cost-effective and discharge free. They are also known for their fast timing performance which could be used to perform 4D construction of the hadronic showers. Such a construction can improve on hadronic showers separation by better associating the energy depots belonging to the same shower from those of other showers. It can also improve on the energy reconstruction by identifying the delayed neutrons and assigning them a different weight.

To obtain excellent  resolution of hadronic shower energy measurement a binary readout of the GRPC is the simplest and most effective scenario. However,  a lateral segmentation of a few millimeters is needed to ensure good linearity and resolution of the reconstructed energy. Such a lateral segmentation leads to a huge number of electronic channels resulting in a complicated readout system design and a too large power consumption.  1x1 cm$^2$ cells are found to be a good compromise that  still provides a very good resolution at moderate energies.  However, simulation studies show that  saturation effects are expected to show up  at higher energies ($\mathrm{> 40\,GeV}$). This happens when many particles cross one  cell in the center of the hadronic shower.  To reduce these effects, the choice of multi-threshold electronics (Semi-Digital) readout is chosen to improve on the energy resolution by exploiting the particle density in a more appropriate way. These elements were behind the development of a Semi-Digital Hadronic CALorimeter (SDHCAL) that we propose to equip one of the CEPC future experiments.

Even with a 1x1 cm$^2$ lateral granularity of the readout system, a huge number of electronic channels is still needed. This has two important consequences.  The first is the power consumption and the resulting increase of temperature which affects the behavior of the active layers. The other consequence is the number of service cables needed to power, read out these channels. These two aspects can deteriorate the performance of the HCAL  and destroy the principle of PFA if they are not addressed properly.

The R\&D pursued by the CALICE SDHCAL groups has succeeded to pass almost all the technical hurdles of the PFA-based HCAL. The SDHCAL groups have succeeded to build the first technological prototype \cite{SDHCAL} of these new-generation calorimeters with 48 active layers of GRPC, 1m$^2$ each. The prototype validates  the concept of high-granularity gaseous detector and permits to study the energy resolution of hadrons  one can obtains with such calorimeter.


\subsubsection{Readout electronics}

To read out  the SDHCAL an ASIC called HARDROC2 was developed.  To solve the problem of connections related to the high number of electronic channels, the option of a detector embedded electronics  using the DAISY chain scheme was chosen and Printed Circuit Board (PCB) were conceived for the readout of large detectors GRPC.

%\subsubsection{ Front-end ASIC}

- {\bf Front-end ASIC}: The HARDROC2 chip (HR) implements a multi-threshold readout which integrates the functionalities of amplification, shaping, digitization, internal triggering and local storage of the data.  Each of its 64 channels consists of a fast low impedance current preamplifier with 8-bit variable gain (in the $[0,2]$ range) followed by 3 fast shapers (15~{ns} shaping time). A low offset discriminator is present on each path and the three corresponding thresholds establish the multi-level readout.  The thresholds are set using three integrated 10-bit Digital to Analog Converters (DAC). The outputs of the three discriminators are then encoded and stored in an internal digital memory latched by a trigger event.  A trigger is generated when one of the lowest level discriminators is fired but can also be configured on the other thresholds.  A frame consists of the 64 encoded discriminator outputs, plus a 24-bit time-stamp and a chip identifier is stored after a trigger is received.
Noisy channels could be easily masked via the configuration parameters control.  In order to avoid fake triggers produced by noisy channels, the output of each discriminator can be switched off from the trigger generator logic via the configuration parameters control (Slow Control hereafter) commands.  The response of all the channels can be calibrated by injecting an analog signal through an integrated 2$\pm$0.02~{pF} input test capacitor; this is a useful tool to make the response of the different channels as uniform as possible~\cite{small}.
The ASIC contains a 127-frame long digital memory. This allows to work in a triggerless mode and keep all the data accumulated during the bench crossing.

Once the memory is full the acquisition is stopped, the  readout is performed and the ASIC can start acquisition again.  The Gray-coded time-stamp is derived from an external 5~{MHz} clock.
 An essential feature of the HR is the possibility to be operated in the power-pulsing mode (PP) that consists of switching off almost all power-consumption functionalities in between the bench crossings (BC) of the electron beams. In the case of CEPC this mode may allow a moderate reduction of the power consumption but this is not enough to prevent the detector heating due to the power consumption. Therefore an embedded active cooling system is needed.

%\subsubsection{Active Sensor Units}

- {\bf Active Sensor Units}: To read out the  1~{m}$^2$ detector of the SDHCAL prototype, an electronic board with the same size is needed.  This electronic board is an important piece in the present design. It hosts both the pick-up pads and the ASICs in addition to the connections between the pads and the ASICs and those linking the different ASICs.   To ensure good transmission qualities and low cross-talk,  50 cm $\times$ 33 cm,   8-layer Printed Circuit Board (PCB) is designed. Each of these ASUs hosts 24  chips to read out 48$\times$32 pads of 1cm $^2$ each.  This dressed PCB is dubbed Active Sensor Unit (ASU). The routing of each input signal from its own pad up to chip pin has been carefully optimized to reduce the cross-talk.
The rooting was conceived so two of the ASUs can be associated to form one slab hosting 48 ASICS.  Each slab is then connected to one Detector InterFace board (DIF). The connection  between the DIF and  the slab as well as the connection of the two ASUs  is performed   thanks to  tiny connectors  allowing the different clocks, signals as well as the power to circulate between the two  ASUs.  Three slabs are then assembled  to form the required electronics board. To ensure the same electric reference level for the  six ASUs, the GND layer of the six ASUs is connected thanks to a copper gasket on all the common sides.   Similar schemes could be proposed for GRPC detectors with larger size.

%\subsubsection{Front-end and back-end boards}

- {\bf Front-end and back-end boards}: The interface between the ASUs and the data acquisition system (DAQ) is realised by the DIF. The main elements of the DIF is an FPGA and USB, HDMI and SAMTEC connectors. It manages the control signals (\textit{e.g.} clock, busy/ready, external/internal trigger, power-pulsing) and supply power to the ASICs and also performs the readout of the ASIC memories. DIFs are read out by other FPGA-based boards called Data Concentrator Cards (DCC). They can be connected up to 9 DIFs through HDMI links and are controlled by a synchronous DCC (or SDCC). The SDCC can connects to up to 9 DCCs to which it distributes the clock and the commands. It is also connected to the computer network for the user to control the DAQ.

%\subsubsection{ Acquisition software}
- {\bf Data Acquisition software}: To exploit the data collected by  the SDHCAL detectors an acquisition software was developed. This software is organized in three parts. The first one allows to access the hardware devices (DIF, SDCC) through an FTDI chip associated to each of these devices. It transmits the configurations parameters to ASICs through these devices and collect the data as well. The second part is the configuration data base. It gives the possibility to store and retrieve all parameters needed by the DAQ system. The database itself is hosted on an Oracle server. To interface this SQL database with the DAQ software and to allow users to insert and query data without knowledge of SQL, a C++ library has been written. A special care was taken to allow to download the parameters associated to a given parameters of the prototype (roughly 550000 parameters) in few seconds. The third part concerns  the data collection.  Data from different DIFs may be readout at a different times but will have the same Bench Crossing IDentifier (BCID) for a given trigger. The logical way to keep synchronicity is to store in a BCID indexed map the buffers of all read DIFs but it requires to man-age memory allocation, access and cleaning. This was achieved thanks to the abilities offered by recent Linux kernels to use file based shared memory.  In addition, whenever several computers are involved in the data taking, as it is the case for the SDHCAL prototype,  a communication framework is needed. The CMS data acquisition XDAQ framework was chosen. This provides  communication tools, an XML description of the computer and software architecture, a web-server implementation of all data acquisition application and a scalable event builder. A monitoring system was also developed to have an online follow-up of the acquisition during data collection.

\subsubsection{Detector development}

The structure of GRPC proposed as an active layer of the HCAL proposed for CEPC is shown in Figure~\ref{chamber}. It is  made out of two glass plates of 0.7 mm and 1.1 mm thickness.  The thinner is used to form the anode while the the thicker forms the cathode. Ceramic balls of  1.2 mm diameter are used as spacers between the glass plates.  The balls are glued on only one  of the glass plates.  In addition to those balls,  13 cylindrical fiber-glass buttons of 4 mm diameter are also used.  Contrary to the ceramic balls the buttons  are glued to both plates ensuring thus a robust structure. Special spacers (ceramic balls) were used to maintain uniform  gas gap of 1.2 mm. Their number and distribution were optimized to reduce the noise and dead zones ($0.1 \%$).

The distance between the spacers (10 cm)  was fixed so that the deviation of the gap distance between the two plates under the glass weight and the electric force does not exceed 45 microns.  The choice of these spacers rather than fishing lines was intended to reduce the dead zones ($0.1 \%$).  It was also aimed at reducing the noise contribution observed along the fishing lines in standard GRPC chambers.  The gas volume is closed by a 1.2 mm thick and 3 mm wide glass-fiber frame  glued on both glass plates. The glue used for both the frame and the spacers was chosen for its chemical passivity and long term performance.  The resistive coating on the glass plates which is used to apply the high voltage and thus to create the electric field in the gas volume was found to play important role in the pad multiplicity associated to a mip \cite{small}. A product  based on colloids containing graphite was developed. It is  applied on the outer faces of the two electrodes using the silk screen print method, which ensures very uniform surface quality. The measured surface resistivity at various points over a 1m$^2$ glass coated with the previous  paint showed a mean value of 1.2 M$\Omega/\square$ and a ratio of the maximum to minimum values of less than 2 ensuring a good homogeneity of the detector.

Another important aspect of this development concerns the gas circulation within the GRPC taking into account that for the CEPC SDHCAL,  gas outlets should all be on one side.  A genuine system was proposed. It is based on channeling  the gas along one side of the chamber and releasing it into the main gas volume at regular intervals. A similar system is used to collect the gas on the opposite side.  A finite element model has been established to check the gas distribution. The simulation confirms that the gas speed is reasonably uniform over most of the chamber area.
The GRPC and its associated electronics are housed in a special cassette which protects the chamber and ensures that the readout board is in intimate contact with the anode glass. The cassette is a thin box consisting of 2.5 mm thick  stainless steel plates separated by 6 mm wide stainless steel spacers. Its plates are also a part of the absorber.

The electronics board is assembled thanks to a polycarbonate spacer which is also used to fill the gaps between the readout chips and to improve the overall rigidity of the detector. The electronics board is fixed on the small plate of the cassette.  Thanks to tiny screws and the new set is fixed on the other plate which hosts the detector and the spacers. The whole width of the cassette is 11 mm with only 6 of them corresponding to the sensitive medium including the GRPC detector and the readout electronics.

\subsubsection{SDHCAL technological prototype}

An SDHCAL prototype fulfilling the efficiency, robustness and the compactness requirements of the future PFA-based leptonic collider experiments~\cite{SDHCAL} was built. 48 cassettes as the one described above were built. They fulfilled a stringent quality control.   It is worth mentioning that 10500 HR ASICs were produced and tested using a dedicated robot for this purpose. The yield was found to be higher than 92\%.  The ASICs were then fixed on the PCBs to make a 1m$^2$ and itself fixed on the cassette cover once successfully tested.    The cassettes were inserted in a self-supporting mechanical structure that was conceived and built  in collaboration with the Spanish group of CIEMAT. The structure is made of Stainless Steel plates of 1.5 cm each. The plates were machined to have an excellent flatness and well controlled thickness. The flatness of the plates was measured using a laser-based interferometer system. It was found that the flatness of  the plates are less than 500 microns. This results guarantees that for the SDHCAL V structure proposed for ILD, a tolerance of less than 1mm is achievable.
The prototype construction  lasted less than 6 months. A commissioning test at CERN in 2011 allowed to understand the whole system behavior.
In April 2012 the prototype was exposed to pion, muon, electron beams of both the PS and the SPS of CERN Figure (\ref{Prototype}). Power-pulsed mode was applied to the whole prototype using the beam cycle structure (0.3 ms time duration for the PS beam and 9 s for the SPS beam every 45s).
The data were collected continuously in a triggerless mode.
Figure~\ref{Eff} shows the efficiency (left) and pad multiplicity (right) of the prototype's GRPC chambers measured using the muon beam. Figure~\ref{pion} shows a display of two events collected in the SDHCAL. One is a produced by a pion interaction (left) and the other by an electron interaction (right).

The SDHCAL prototype  results obtained  with  a minimum data treatment (no grain correction) show clearly that excellent linearity and good resolution~\cite{FirstResults} could be achieved on large energy scale as can be shown in Figure~\ref{Linearity} where results obtained in two different beam lines are obtained using the same detector configurations.  Useless to mention that the high granularity of the SDHCAL allows one to study thoroughly  the hadronic showers topology and to improve on the energy resolution by, among others,  separating the electromagnetic and the hadronic contribution.  The separation between close-by showers will also get big benefit thanks to the high granularity on the one hand and to to the very clean detector response ( < 1 Hz/cm$^2$) on the other hand. The results obtained with the the SDHCAL~\cite{Remi} confirm the excellent efficiency of such separation thanks to the SDHCAL performance.    In addition, the high-granularity of the SDHCAL allows to extract the track segments of hadronic showers in a very efficient way~\cite{Hough}. The track segments (Figure~\ref{Hough}) are then used to study the detector behavior in-situ. This  is a simple but powerful control and calibration tool for a running calorimeter.

The quality of data obtained during several campaigns of  data taking at the CERN PS and SPS beam lines validates completely the SDHCAL concept.  This is especially encouraging since no gain correction was applied to the electronics channels to equalize their response. Still, improvement was further  achieved by applying gain and threshold correction schemes in terms of  the calorimeter response homogeneity.

A digitizer describing the response of the  GRPC within the SDHCAL was developed~\cite{Digitizer}. It allows to study the SDHCAL behavior in a realistic manner in the future experiments.

In parallel to the prototype construction, a single cassette was tested in a magnetic field of 3 Tesla (H2 line at CERN) applying the power-pulsed mode.  The TB results~\cite{PP} indicated clearly that the use of the power-pulsed mode in such a magnetic field is possible. The behavior of the detector (efficiency, multiplicity..) was found to be similar to those obtained in the absence of both the magnetic field and the power-pulsed mode.

\subsubsection{Preparation for future experiments}

A genuine self-supporting mechanical structure to host the hadronic calorimeter of future PFA-based leptonic collider experiments was fully studied.   The structure (called V-structure) was conceived to eliminate the projective holes and cracks so none of the particles produced close to the detector centre could escape detection. The V-structure has additional advantages. It eliminates in principle the space between the barrel and the Endcaps avoiding the shower deformation which results  not only  because of  this space but also  of the different cables and services needed in CMS-like mechanical structures.  In this structure the different services such as  the gas tubes, data collection and electric cables of both the barrel and the Endcaps are taken out from the outer radius side.Detailed studies have shown that the deformation of this structure is extremely low and its robustness was verified experimentally with the SDHCAL technological prototype built with a self-supporting structure respecting the spirit of the V one.  Services and  Integration issues were also worked out.  Besides, realistic costing was performed , based on the prototype experience.

\subsubsection{current SDHCAL R\&D}

Large GRPC of 1m$^2$ were developed and built for the technological prototype. However, larger GRPC are needed in the SDHCAL proposed for future leptonic collider experiments.  These large chambers with gas inlet and outlet on one side need a dedicated study to guarantee a uniform gas gap everywhere notwithstanding the angle of the plate. It is necessary also to ensure an efficient gas distribution as it was done for the 1m2 chambers. To obtain this different gas distribution systems were studied. A new scheme with two gas inlets and one outlet was found to ensure an excellent homogeneity of the gas distribution. This system will be used in the near future to build large detectors exceeding 2m$^2$.
The readout of such chambers needs also to be as efficient as the one of the technological prototype 1m$^2$. An upgrade of the HR ASIC allowing larger dynamic range (01-50 pC) was conceived, produced and successfully tested. The new ASIC (HR3) allows to be directly addressed and easily bypassed in case of failure thanks to the I2C protocol. In addition and contrary to the HR2, the 64 channels of the new ASIC are independent which allows a better calibration procedure.  Furthermore, a new interface board (DIF) is conceived to control the ASICs synchronization and data transfer. Indeed, the space left between the active layer of one module and the cryostat maybe very short in future leptonic experiments (< 5 cm).  This means that the DIF components should be optimized to cope with the volume availability. A new design with new functionalities of the DIF is proposed.  A TPC/IP protocol is adopted for data transfer and a TTC one for the clock synchronisation.  A microprocessor implemented on the new DIF is in charge of the communication between the ASICs and the DIF's FPGA. The new DIF shown in Fig.~\ref{NewDIF} is capable to address up to 432 ASIC.  A new PCB design that allows to assemble few boards to cover up to 3 m$^2$ GRPC detector  was also conceived. Care is taken to ensure robust and flexible but still tiny connection between the different PCB to build a large one. Fig.~\ref{NewPCB} shows a picture of such a PCB equipped with the HR3 ASICs.  Finally a new  technique based on electron beam welding is being tested to build a mechanical structure.  This intends to reduce the steel quantity used to assemble the absorber plates while guaranteeing a minimum deformation. First attempts have taken place at CERN recently ~\ref{EBW} and more study is ongoing to determine the best protocol one should follow to obtain optimal results.
Finally, to cope with the heating produced by the embedded readout system in case of limited or even the absence of use of the Power Pulsing system, a new active cooling system is being studied. Figure~\ref{Cooling} shows a study of a water-based cooling system to absorb the excess of heat in the SDHCAL. The cooling system is very simple but very effective as well. It allows to keep the average temperature as well as the temperature dispersion of the GRPC well under control.

\section{Dual-readout Calorimetry}
\subsection{Introduction}

Till now, the performance obtained in hadronic energy measurements has
been by far worse than for the electromagnetic ones, since showers from
single hadrons or jets develop an electromagnetic component ($em$
fraction, $f_{em}$), from $\pi^0$ and $\eta$ production, that exhibits
large event-by-event fluctuations and dependence on the particle type and
energy~\cite{wigmans_cal}.

As a matter of fact, the $em$ fraction changes as a function of the
particle initiating the shower (e.g., $\pi$, $K$, $p$) since, for example,
impinging $\pi^{\pm}$ mesons can undergo a charge-exchange reaction with
a nucleon as first interaction and generate a pure $em$ shower, while a
$p$ can't do that.

Moreover, since $\pi^0$ production happens at any stage of shower
development, the $f_{em}$ increases with the energy as well as with the
depth ("age") of the shower.

The $em$ and $non-em$ components of a hadronic shower are normally sampled
with very different sensitivity, producing large differences in the
measured signals, heavily affecting the energy resolution capability.

To overcome the problem two methods have been exploited: compensation and
dual readout (DR). The first relies on equalising the detector response to
electromagnetic and non-electromagnetic shower particles but requires the
integration of the signals over large volumes (and long time) and leads to
limited resolution for electromagnetic showers. The DR method allows to
avoid these limitations by measuring and accounting for the $f_{em}$, on
event-by-event basis. The showers are sampled through two independent
processes, namely scintillation and \v{C}erenkov light emissions. The
former is sensitive to all ionizing particles, while the latter is
produced by highly relativistic particles only, almost exclusively found
inside the $em$ shower component. By combining the two measurements,
energy and $f_{em}$ of each shower can be simultaneously reconstructed.
The performance in hadronic calorimetry may be boosted toward its ultimate
limit.

Over the last 15 years, the DREAM/RD52 collaboration at CERN has deeply
investigated both homogeneous and sampling DR solutions~\cite{rd52_reference}.
The first don't suffer from sampling fluctuations and have, in principle,
much higher light yields.

Nevertheless, the two signals are mixed together and must be separated by
means of optical filters and/or timing properties. Last but not least, the
cost of building a fully-homogeneous hadronic calorimeter looks
prohibitive.

On the other hand, in sampling calorimeters, the two signals (from
scintillation and \v{C}erenkov light) are separated by construction since
they are measured in independent detector elements. The results obtained
so far show that a sampling fibre calorimeter may reach resolutions close
to $10\% / \sqrt{E}$ for $em$ showers and better than $\sim 30-40\% /
\sqrt{E}$ for hadronic showers, coupled with strong standalone particle-ID
capabilities. This allows $W \rightarrow jj$ separation from $Z
\rightarrow jj$ by invariant mass, high-precision missing $\nu$
three-vector by subtraction, $e$-$\mu$-$\pi$ separation and tagging.

The intrinsic high granularity, exploited with Silicon Photo-Multipliers
(SiPM) single-fibre readout, may as well provide powerful input to
particle flow algorithms.

Indeed, while the DR concept has been extensively proven and
experimentally validated in a series of beam tests, the use of standard
Photo-Multiplier (PM) tubes to read out the \v{C}erenkov and scintillation
light has so far limited its development towards a full-scale system
compliant with the integration in a particle detector at a colliding beam
machine. These limitations can be overcome using SiPM, low-cost
solid-state sensors of light with single photon sensitivity, magnetic
field compliance and design flexibility. Concerning devices built on
materials other than silicon, a relevant advantage in the detection of the
\v{C}erenkov light could in principle come from the development of sensors
based on Silicon Carbide (SiC), essentially because of its UV sensitivity
and visible-light blindness.

\subsection{Dual-Readout Calorimetry}

The independent sampling of hadronic showers, through scintillation and
\v{C}erenkov light emission, allows to fully reconstruct, at the same
time, energy and $f_{em}$ of hadronic showers. In fact, the total detected
signals, measured with respect to the electromagnetic energy scale, can be
expressed as:

\begin{align}
S\ =\ E\ [\ f_{em}\ +\ \eta_S \cdot (1-f_{em})\ ]
\end{align}
\begin{align}
C\ =\ E\ [\ f_{em}\ +\ \eta_C \cdot (1-f_{em})\ ]
\end{align}

where $\eta_S = (e/h)_S$ ($\eta_C = (e/h)_C$) is the relative yield of the scintillation
(\v{C}erenkov) signal for the $em$ to the hadronic component of the shower.
The system can be easily solved giving:

\begin{align}
{\frac{C}{S}}\ =\ \frac{[\ f_{em}\ +\ \eta_C \cdot (1-f_{em})\ ]}
           {[\ f_{em}\ +\ \eta_S \cdot (1-f_{em})\ ]}
\end{align}
\begin{align}
E\ =\ \frac{S\ -\ \chi C} {1\ -\ \chi}
\end{align}
where:
\begin{align}
\chi\ =\ \frac {1 - \eta_S} {1 - \eta_C} \ =\ \cot\ \theta
\end{align}

This is the simplest formulation of hadronic calorimeter response: an $em$
part with relative response of unity, and a $non-em$ part with relative
response $\eta$.

There are two unknowns for each shower, $E$ and $f_{em}$, and two
measurements S and C. The electromagnetic fraction, $f_{em}$, is
determined entirely by the ratio C/S, and the shower energy calculated as
in Eq. (4). Both C and S $(e/h)$ ratios have event-by-event fluctuations
and should be considered stochastic variables, nevertheless the average
${<}e/h{>}$ values are essentially independent of hadron energy and
species~\cite{pdg_hadroncalorimetry,groom_nim572,groom_nim593}.
The global parameter $\chi$ can be extracted with a fit to calibration
data:

\begin{align}
\chi\ =\ \frac {E_0 - S} {E_0 - C}
\end{align}

\begin{align}
S\ = \ (1-\chi)E_0 + \chi C
\end{align}

where $E_0$ is the beam energy. \hfill

The geometrical meaning of the $\theta$ angle can be understood by looking
at the scatter plor of C versus S signals. In
Figure~\ref{fig:theta_angle5}, there are both (a) a prediction for the
normalised scatter plot for protons and pions, and (b) the observed
scatter plot for 60 GeV pions, in the RD52 lead/fibre calorimeter.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{Figures/Calorimetry/theta_angle5.eps}
    %%% \includegraphics[width= 0.55\textwidth]{Figures/Calorimetry/theta_angle5.eps}
  \caption{(a) Scatter plot of C/E versus S/E in a dual-readout
calorimeter for $p$ and $\pi$; (b) scatter plot of C versus S signals for
60 GeV pions in the RD52 dual-readout lead/fibre calorimeter.}
  \label{fig:theta_angle5}
\end{figure}

The plot in Figure~\ref{fig:theta_angle5}(b) shows the data points located
on a locus, clustered around a line that intersects the C/S = 1 line at
the beam energy of 60 GeV. $\chi$ is the energy-independent slope of the
event locus. This is to be expected. In first approximation, the signal
generated in the \v{C}erenkov fibers is produced only by the $em$
components of the hadron showers. The larger the $em$ fraction $f_{em}$,
the larger the C/S signal ratio. Events in which (almost) the entire
hadronic energy is deposited in the form of $em$ shower components give
signals very similar to those from 60 GeV electrons and are, therefore,
represented by data points located near (S=60, C=60) in the plot.

All signals are relative to the $em$ scale meaning that both the
\v{C}erenkov and the scintillation responses have to be calibrated with
electrons only, i.e. no hadronic calibration is required. This is one of
the most qualifying point of dual-readout calorimetry.

The effectiveness of this approach has been probed by the DREAM/RD52
collaboration over a 15-year research program with a variety of detector
solutions. Results and
simulations~\cite{rd52_pid2014,rd52_em2014,rd52_sim2014,rd52_em2016,wigmans_nimA824,rd52_hadr2017}
provide, so far, confidence
that a fibre-sampling calorimeter, even without longitudinal segmentation,
may meet the requirements of the CepC physics programme in a
cost-effective way. Linearity and energy resolution, for both $em$ and
hadronic showers, $e/\pi/\mu$ separation, spatial resolution, all show
adequate performance.

\subsection{Layout and Mechanics}

\subsubsection{Layout}

A possible projective layout has been studied by the 4th Detector
Collaboration and described in its LoI~\cite{4th_loi}.
Assuming the converter to be
copper, the calorimeter is a copper matrix loaded with 1 mm diameter, 1 mm
apart, alternate scintillating and clear (for \v{C}erenkov light
detection) fibres. About 200 $cm$ (10 $\lambda$) long, projective towers
cover (at $\theta \sim 90^\circ$) about 1.4$^{\circ}$ in both $\phi$ and
$\theta$, with of the order of 2000 fibres per tower. The dimensions of
the inner faces in the barrel section depend on $\theta$, and increase
going in the forward direction. The sampling fraction is kept constant by
fibres starting at different depths inside each tower.

This layout has been already imported in the simulations for the CepC
detector and will be validated in the next months.

\subsubsection{Mechanics (Material Choice and Machining)}

Both lead and copper have been used as absorber materials by the
DREAM/RD52 collaboration. Their main properties are:

\begin{align}
Lead: \rho= 11.3\ g/cm^3,\ X_0= 0.56\ cm,\ \rho_{Mol}= 1.60\ cm,\ \lambda_{int}= 170\ mm
\end{align}
\begin{align}
Copper: \rho= 8.96\ g/cm^3,\ X_0= 1.44\ cm,\ \rho_{Mol}= 1.56\ cm,\ \lambda_{int}= 151\ mm
\end{align}

meaning that, for hadronic showers, a full-coverage solution with lead
will give broader and longer showers and a total mass 42\% heavier than
using copper. A full-containment $ 3 \times 3 \times 10\ \lambda^3 $
prototype will need about 5 tons of material with lead and 2.8 tons with
copper.

An even stronger reason in favour of copper is the fact that, being the
\v{C}erenkov light almost exclusively produced by the $em$ shower
components and the (e/mip) ratio 50\% higher for copper than for lead, the
\v{C}erenkov light yield should be significantly higher in copper,
resulting in a better hadronic resolution.

On the other hand, copper extrusion, with the required tolerances in
planarity and groove parallelism, is not yet an established industrial
process. A variety of techniques (extrusion, rolling, scraping and
milling) for machining the converter layers have been tested, essentially
by John Hauptman and collaborators at Iowa State University and by
Fabrizio Scuri at INFN-Pisa. None has been qualified for a large-scale
production and identifying an industrial and cost-effective process,
including moulding, is a relevant issue.

In the 3-year R\&D INFN program, under discussion, the identification of
an industrial procedure to produce the converter layers is one key point.

Alternative copper alloys (brass, bronze) will be investigated as well,
both for addressing the production process issues and for optimising the
detector performance.

\subsection{DREAM/RD52 Prototype Studies}

Different prototypes were built and studied by the DREAM/RD52
collaboration, with copper or lead as absorber. A summary of the most
significant results~\cite{rd52_pid2014,rd52_em2014,rd52_sim2014,rd52_em2016,wigmans_nimA824,rd52_hadr2017} is given, in particular for the matrices
built in 2012: a matrix of 9 lead modules and a matrix of 2 copper
modules, each module $9.3 \times 9.3 \times 250\ cm^3$ (see
Figure~\ref{fig:AllDet} for the mechanical details, the first DREAM
calorimeter built in 2003 is also shown on the top). From the readout
point of view, the calorimeter was arranged as in
Figure~\ref{fig:rd52_2012}.

  \caption{The RD52 calorimeter as tested at the end of 2012. It consisted
of 9 lead-based modules, each consisting of 4 towers (towers 1-36), and 2
copper-based modules, placed on top of the lead array. Each tower was
readout by two photomultipliers, one for scintillation and one for
\v{C}erenkov light detection. The left copper module (of which the towers
are marked as “Al”) was equipped with \v{C}erenkov fibres with an
aluminised upstream end face. For the measurements described in this
paper, the particle beams were typically steered in the center of tower
T15.}
  \label{fig:rd52_2012}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Electromagnetic Performance}

In Figure~\ref{fig:emLin} the linearity of the response for both matrices
is shown. The range of measurement is different for the two (spanning 6-60
GeV for Cu and 60-150 GeV for Pb). The deviations for the very first
points ($\lesssim 10\ GeV$) are likely due to the spread of the energy of
the beam particles.

calorimeters for em shower detection in the scintillation and \v{C}erenkov
channels.}
  \label{fig:emLin}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:emProf} shows the radial shower profile and the sensivity
to the impact point: the core of the signal spans just few mm.
Figure~\ref{fig:impactScan} shows the dependence of the S signal on the
impact point for particles entering parallel to the fibres. This
introduces a constant term in the resolution that can be avoided with a
small tilt of the fibre axis. In the C fibres, the problem doesn't show up
since the early (collimated) part of the shower produces photons outside
the numerical fibre aperture.

  \caption{The scintillation signal for 100 GeV electrons developing
showers in the lead matrix as a function of the beam impact point.}
  \label{fig:impactScan}
\end{figure}

For the reconstruction of the energy of $em$ showers, C and S signals
provide independent uncorrelated measurements, with different sensitivity
of the response. They are affected by different problems: S signals have a
photo-electron statistics of at least one order of magnitude higher than C
signals, and their fluctuations are largely dominated by the sampling
fluctuation of the energy deposits. C signal fluctuations are generally
dominated by the limited photo-electron statistics, expecially at low
energies. Nevertheless, for C signals, the constant term is negligible
giving a better resolution at high energies. Averaging the two measures
improves the resolution up to a factor of $\sqrt 2$. Separate and combined
(unweighted) results for the copper matrix are shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:40gevRes} for 40 GeV electrons.

\begin{figure}

In Figure~\ref{fig:CuPbRes}, the electromagnetic resolution is shown for
the 2 matrices.

\phi$) was ($1.5^\circ, 1.0^\circ$). The size of the beam spot was $10

  \label{fig:CuPbRes}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Hadronic Performance}

The RD52 lead matrix response was studied with pion and proton beams~\cite{rd52_hadr2017}.  High-multiplicity events ("jets") were also generated by means of
a target. The energy was reconstructed with the dual-readout relation (Eq.
4), that restores a gaussian behaviour and linearity of the response
(Figure~\ref{fig:DRsignal} and Figure~\ref{fig:linResp}).

\begin{figure}

\v{C}erenkov signal and the dual-readout signal (Eq. 4) per unit deposited

  \label{fig:linResp}
\end{figure}

The comparison of $p$ and $\pi$ signals at 80 GeV is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:pi_prot}, confirming that the method largely compensates
for the differences in shower composition.

\begin{figure}

  \label{fig:pi_prot}
\end{figure}

The limited lateral size of the matrix (about 1 $\lambda$) allows to
collect, in average, $\sim 90\%$ of the shower energy so that leakage
fluctuations dominate the resolution capability. Leakage counters were
used to select events about fully contained (that of course, tend to have
a higher $f_{em}$). The resolution improves by a factor of almost 2 in
this case (Figure~\ref{fig:leak_eff}). A second effect affecting
resolution is the light attenuation in the fibres, that causes early
starting showers to be observed at lower signal values. The hadronic
resolution, to be corrected for both effects, was reconstructed
to be $\sim {70\%}/{\sqrt E}$.

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}

Geant4 simulations point at a possible resolution of $\sim {30\%}/{\sqrt
E}$, allowing sensible separation of the $W/Z$ decays to jet pairs
(Figure~\ref{fig:had_sim_res}). The figure summarizes the situation
concerning the hadronic energy resolution, for single pions. Experimental
data on hadronic performance compared to GEANT4 simulations are shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:had_sim_res}(a). The experimental data obtained with the
original DREAM fibre calorimeter, which had a lateral cross-section of
$820\ cm^2$, are compared~\cite{wigmans_nimA824} with simulations using
the standard FTFP\_BERT hadronic simulation package for the geometry of that
detector. The improvement expected for a larger detector ($65 \times 65\ cm^2$
lateral cross-section) with the RD52 geometry is also shown, both for the
standard FTFP\_BERT package and for the high-precision version of this
package. For comparison, the record setting experimental data reported by
SPACAL~\cite{spacal_epimulti} are also shown, as well as a curve representing an energy
resolution of $30\%/\sqrt{E}$.

package.}

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{$e/\pi$ Separation}

Four discriminating variables were identified for implementing $e/\pi$
separation: the fraction of energy in the central tower, the
\v{C}erenkov/scintillation light signal ratio, the signal starting time,
the total charge/amplitude ratio, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:e_pi_discr}. A
multivariate neural network analysis showed that the best $e/\pi$
separation achievable for 60 GeV beams was $99.8\%$ of electron
identification efficiency with $0.2\%$ pion misidentification. Further
improvements may be expected by including the full time structure
information of the pulses, especially if the upstream ends of the fibers
are made reflective.

(b), starting time of the PM signal (c), ratio of the integrated charge
and the amplitude of the signals (d), for electron and pion showers.}
  \label{fig:e_pi_discr}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Sensors and Readout Electronics}

Separately read out the signals from the \v{C}erenkov and scintillation
fibre forest and avoid oversampling of late developing showers is an issue
that may be successfully addressed through the use of Silicon
Photo-Multipliers (SiPM), allowing the separate reading of each fibre and
magnetic field insensitivity. This, in principle, assuming powering and
cooling don't pose issues, allows for a transversal segmentation as small
as possible. SiPM are low-cost solid state light sensors with
single photon sensitivity that underwent an impressive development over
the last years. Tests done in the last 2 years by the RD52 collaboration
show that effective solutions for small scale prototypes are very close
already now. Thanks to their higher photon detection efficiency wrt
standard PM, the \v{C}erenkov light signal should be improved with a gain
in the resolution for hadronic showers. On the other hand, the
scintillation light spans a very large dynamic range and saturation and
non-linearity effects were observed already for low-energy $em$ showers.
In Figure~\ref{fig:pe_gev}, the number of photoelectrons per GeV measured
in July 2017, with a very small module ($1 cm^2$ section, 32 + 32 fibres)
is shown. The most relevant technical specifications of the sensors were
1600, $25 \times 25\ \mu m^2$, cells, and a $25\%$ nominal detection
efficiency.

\begin{figure}

$25\%$ nominal PDE.}
  \label{fig:pe_gev}
\end{figure}

C signals show a linear response with about 30 p.e./GeV while S signals
shows a decreasing sensitivity starting at around 1000 p.e./GeV, for 10
GeV electron showers. It should be mentioned the fact that the shower
containment is around $40\%$. Last but not least, the problem of serious
light leaks of the S signals to the neighbouring C SiPM, observed in the
first 2016 tests, looks solved thanks to a staggered readout of the C and
S fibres (Figure~\ref{fig:staggered_t}).

\begin{figure}

\subsubsection{Sensor Choice}

As far as the scintillation light detection is concerned, saturation or
non linearity should largely disappear with higher density devices (e.g.
with 10000, $10 \times 10\ \mu m^2$, cells). The definition of the
optimal dynamic range and the qualification of existing silicon
photomultipliers in that regard, will be likely addressed in a short-term
$R\&D$ phase.

For the \v{C}erenkov light, improvements of the photon collection may come
with the development of Silicon Carbide (SiC) sensors, that are expected
to provide exclusive UV sensitivity (i.e. visible-light blindness). It
must be said that the R\&D of these device is at a very early stage and
they still miss a proof that they will really give a significant
improvement in the \v{C}erenkov light detection. A program for the
development and qualification of SiC sensors is under discussion at INFN.

\subsubsection{Front-End Electronics and Readout}

Concerning the front-end, the development shall certainly evaluate the use
of Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC), to handle and reduce
the information to be trasferred to the DAQ system. A major question is
finding the optimal way for summing signals from a plurality of sensors
into a single output channel. Available ASICs will have to be analysed,
compared and qualified with the goal to select the optimal one and/or
define the specification for a dedicated design to be pursued at a later
stage.
The development and usage of a feature-extracting processor has to be
considered, in particular for addressing the problem of disentangling
overlapping $em$ and hadronic showers.

\subsection{Monte Carlo Simulations}

Geant4 simulations (version 10.02.p01-10.03.p01, with FTFP\_BERT\_HP
physics list) are under development and analysis for understanding the
performance of both testbeam modules and a $4 \pi$ calorimeter integrated
in a detector, with magnetic field, tracking and preshower elements.

\subsubsection{$em$ Performance}

A $31 \times 31 \times 100\ cm^3$ Cu matrix, with 1 mm fibres at 1 mm
distance, has been simulated for the evaluation of the electromagnetic
performance. PMMA clear fibres and Polystirene scintillating fibres, with
a 3\% thick cladding ($C_2F_2$ Fluorinated Polymer for clear and PMMA for
scintillating fibres), were the sensitive elements.

A small ($\lesssim 1^\circ$) tilt angle was introduced to avoid large non
gaussian tails in the scintillation signal due to channeling and
oversampling.

The energy containment for 20 GeV electrons was estimated to be $\sim
43.4\%$, with sampling fractions of 5.3\% and 6.0\% (see
Figure~\ref{fig:edep}), for scintillating and clear fibres, respectively.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  %%% \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{Figures/Calorimetry/edep.eps}
  \includegraphics[width= 0.66\textwidth]{Figures/Calorimetry/edep.eps}
  \caption{Energy deposited in scintillating (a) and \v{C}erenkov (b)
fibres, by 20 GeV electrons.}
  \label{fig:edep}
\end{figure}

Given the integral sampling fraction of about 11.3\% and the 1 mm thick
fibres, the contribution to the energy resolution due to sampling
fluctuations can be estimated to be around:

\begin{align}
\frac {\sigma}{E}\ =\ 2.7\% \times \frac {\sqrt{1/0.113}}{\sqrt E}\ =\
\frac {8.0\%}{\sqrt E}
\end{align}

ultimate limit on the $em$ resolution.

One of the main (blocking) issue was the cpu time needed for the light
propagation up to the photodetectors, dominated by the scintillating
photons. Nevertheless the analysis has shown that the fluctuations in the
detection of the scintillating light (about 5500 photoelectrons/GeV) are
largely dominated by the energy sampling fluctuations
(Figure~\ref{fig:sci_cer_fluc}(a)). This is not true for the \v{C}erenkov
light signals (Figure~\ref{fig:sci_cer_fluc}(b)), which sensitivity is
estimated to be of about 108 photoelectrons/GeV.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{Figures/Calorimetry/sci_cer_fluc.eps}
  %%% \includegraphics[width= 0.55\textwidth]{Figures/Calorimetry/sci_cer_fluc.eps}
  \caption{Relative fluctuation of the total signal detected in the
scintillating (a) and \v{C}erenkov (b) fibres, for both the energy deposit
and the number of photoelectrons.}
  \label{fig:sci_cer_fluc}
\end{figure}

So, the propagation of the scintillation light has been switched off
without biasing the detector performance while for the \v{C}erenkov photons
a parameterization has been introduced, convoluting the effect of the
light attenuation, the angular acceptance and the Photon Detection
Efficiency (PDE). The performance obtained in this way with a single
thread over a 2.0 GHz processor ranges from $\sim 11.3 s$ at 40 GeV up to
$\sim 72 s$ at 250 GeV.

In Figure~\ref{fig:em_res_geant} the resolutions are shown for both C and
S signals, separately, and for the unweighted average value of the two.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  %%% \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{Figures/Calorimetry/em_res_geant.eps}
  \includegraphics[width= 0.66\textwidth]{Figures/Calorimetry/em_res_geant.eps}
  \caption{Relative resolution for $em$ showers for the C and S signals,
independently, and for the average of the two.}
  \label{fig:em_res_geant}
\end{figure}

The fit to the data points gives:

\begin{align}
S\ only:\ \frac {\sigma}{E}\ =\ \frac {10.1\%}{\sqrt E} + 1.1\%
\end{align}
\begin{align}
C\ only:\ \frac {\sigma}{E}\ =\ \frac {17.3\%}{\sqrt E} + 0.1\%
\end{align}
\begin{align}
combined:\ \frac {\sigma}{E}\ =\ \frac {10.1\%}{\sqrt E} + 0.4\%
\end{align}

A sligthly better result using a weighted average is under evaluation.

\subsubsection{Short Term Planning and Open Issues}

The performance for single hadrons, jets and $\tau$.s has to be understood
and the work has just started. For validation, the comparison with the
data taken with the Pb matrix (the only recent prototype with a sensible
hadronic shower containment) is planned.

About the $em$ simulations, the priority will be the comparison with the
2017 testbeam data and the calibration of the absolute photoelectron scale
for the \v{C}erenkov light.

In general, an understanding of light attenuation effects is also needed,
for a $\sim 2-2.5 m$ long detector, that affect the hadronic resolution as
a function of the shower development point (late starting showers will
give bigger and faster signals).
The evaluation of pro/cons of filters (to dump the short
attenuation-lenght components) and mirrors (to increase the number of
photons that may reach the photodetectors) may be relevant in this
context.

The effects of the integration of a preshower detector have to be
evaluated and the $e/\pi$ separation assessed and quantified, for both
isolated particles and within jets.

About physics, a (non exhaustive) list of benchmark channels to be studied
is: $H\rightarrow \gamma \gamma$, $H\rightarrow \tau \tau$, $H\rightarrow
gg$, $Z\rightarrow jj$, $W\rightarrow jj$, $H\rightarrow ZZ^* \rightarrow
4j$, $H\rightarrow WW^* \rightarrow 4j$.

\subsection{Final Remarks}

After a 15-year long research program on dual-readout calorimetry of the
DREAM/RD52 collaboration, this technology looks mature for the application
in future experimental programs. The results show that the parallel,
independent, readout of scintillation and \v{C}erenkov light, makes
possible to cancel the effects of the fluctuations of the electromagnetic
fraction of hadronic showers, dominating the energy resolution of most
calorimeters built so far. In conjunction with high-resolution $em$ and
hadronic energy measurements, excellent standalone particle-id capability
has been demonstrated as well.

Those results give increasing support to the convinction that a a matrix
of alternating scintillating and clear fibres, inserted in copper strips
and readout by Silicon PhotoMultipliers (SiPM), should be able to provide
performance more than adequate for the physics programs at the proposed
future CepC collider.

Nevertheless, there is a series of technical and physics issues that needs
to be solved in order to arrive up to the design of a realistic $4\pi$
detector.
An INFN project, with a 3 year programme, is going to be discussed in
the next weeks, aiming at addressing the main problems:

a) The industrial machining of foils of copper (or some other material)
with the required precision.

b) The readout of the high granularity matrices of SiPM that, in order to be
effective, will require the development of a dedicated Application Specific
Integrated Circuit (ASIC). Possible aggregations of more fibre outputs into
a single channel have also to be implemented and studied.

c) The development of a modular solution and the assessment, at all levels,
of its performance, through beam tests of small modules and simulations.
An intensive program of simulations is already ongoing, with the target of
the CepC CDR. The response to single particles and jets is under study,
in standalone configurations. The work for understanding the behaviour of
a calorimeter integrated in a full detector, with a tracking and a magnetic
system, has also started. This will include, as well, the evaluation of the
combined performance with a preshower detector in front.
