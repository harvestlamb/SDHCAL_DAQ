TIMING-9#1 Warning
Unknown CDC Logic  
One or more asynchronous Clock Domain Crossing has been detected between 2 clock domains through a set_false_path or a set_clock_groups or set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint but no double-registers logic synchronizer has been found on the side of the capture clock.

TIMING-14#1 Warning
LUT on the clock tree  
The LUT usbcmdfifo_16depth_i_2 has been found on the clock tree. Run opt_design to optimize the clock trees, then re-run report_methodology.
