2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-2#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock source pin  
A primary clock Clk_320M is created on an inappropriate pin Clk_Gen/BUFG_Clk_320M/O. It is recommended to create a primary clock only on a proper clock source (input port or primitive output pin with no timing arc)
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-4#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock Clk_320M is defined downstream of clock Pll_320M and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#1 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks Clk_320M and pll_40 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks Clk_320M] -to [get_clocks pll_40]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks pll_40 and Clk_320M are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks pll_40] -to [get_clocks Clk_320M]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-9#1 Warning
Unknown CDC Logic  
One or more asynchronous Clock Domain Crossing has been detected between 2 clock domains through a set_false_path or a set_clock_groups or set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint but no double-registers logic synchronizer has been found on the side of the capture clock. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-14#1 Warning
LUT on the clock tree  
The LUT usbcmdfifo_16depth_i_2 has been found on the clock tree. Run opt_design to optimize the clock trees, then re-run report_methodology. If LUT(s) are still present in the clock trees, modify the RTL or the synthesis options accordingly to move the clock gating logic to dedicated clock enable resources. Keep in mind that post-opt_design database cannot be used for pin-planning tasks
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-14#2 Warning
LUT on the clock tree  
The LUT usbcmdfifo_16depth_i_3 has been found on the clock tree. Run opt_design to optimize the clock trees, then re-run report_methodology.

TIMING-24#1 Warning
Overridden Max delay datapath only  
A set_clock_groups or a set_false path (see constraint position 79 in the Timing Constraints window in Vivado IDE) between clocks pll_40 and usb_clkout overrides a set_max_delay -datapath_only (position 88). It is not recommended to override a set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint. Replace the set_clock_groups or set_false_path between clocks with point-to-point set_false_path constraints
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-24#2 Warning
Overridden Max delay datapath only  
A set_clock_groups or a set_false path (see constraint position 79 in the Timing Constraints window in Vivado IDE) between clocks pll_40 and usb_clkout overrides a set_max_delay -datapath_only (position 94). It is not recommended to override a set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint. Replace the set_clock_groups or set_false_path between clocks with point-to-point set_false_path constraints

TIMING-24#3 Warning
Overridden Max delay datapath only  
A set_clock_groups or a set_false path (see constraint position 79 in the Timing Constraints window in Vivado IDE) between clocks usb_clkout and pll_40 overrides a set_max_delay -datapath_only (position 86). It is not recommended to override a set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint. Replace the set_clock_groups or set_false_path between clocks with point-to-point set_false_path constraints

A set_clock_groups or a set_false path (see constraint position 79 in the Timing Constraints window in Vivado IDE) between clocks usb_clkout and pll_40 overrides a set_max_delay -datapath_only (position 96). It is not recommended to override a set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint. Replace the set_clock_groups or set_false_path between clocks with point-to-point set_false_path constraints

TIMING-28#1 Warning
Auto-derived clock referenced by a timing constraint  
The auto-derived clock pll_40 is referenced by name inside timing constraint (see constraint position 78 in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). It is recommended to reference an auto-derived clock by the pin name attached to the clock: get_clocks -of_objects [get_pins Clk_Gen/MMCME2_BASE_inst/CLKOUT1]
