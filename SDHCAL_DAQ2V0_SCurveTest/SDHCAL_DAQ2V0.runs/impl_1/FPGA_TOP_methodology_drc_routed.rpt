2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-9#1 Warning
Unknown CDC Logic  
One or more asynchronous Clock Domain Crossing has been detected between 2 clock domains through a set_false_path or a set_clock_groups or set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint but no double-registers logic synchronizer has been found on the side of the capture clock. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-14#1 Warning
LUT on the clock tree  
The LUT usbcmdfifo_16depth_i_2 has been found on the clock tree. Run opt_design to optimize the clock trees, then re-run report_methodology. If LUT(s) are still present in the clock trees, modify the RTL or the synthesis options accordingly to move the clock gating logic to dedicated clock enable resources. Keep in mind that post-opt_design database cannot be used for pin-planning tasks
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-14#2 Warning
LUT on the clock tree  
The LUT usbcmdfifo_16depth_i_3 has been found on the clock tree. Run opt_design to optimize the clock trees, then re-run report_methodology. If LUT(s) are still present in the clock trees, modify the RTL or the synthesis options accordingly to move the clock gating logic to dedicated clock enable resources. Keep in mind that post-opt_design database cannot be used for pin-planning tasks

TIMING-24#1 Warning
Overridden Max delay datapath only  
A set_clock_groups or a set_false path (see constraint position 89 in the Timing Constraints window in Vivado IDE) between clocks pll_40 and usb_clkout overrides a set_max_delay -datapath_only (position 92). It is not recommended to override a set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint. Replace the set_clock_groups or set_false_path between clocks with point-to-point set_false_path constraints

TIMING-24#2 Warning
Overridden Max delay datapath only  
A set_clock_groups or a set_false path (see constraint position 89 in the Timing Constraints window in Vivado IDE) between clocks pll_40 and usb_clkout overrides a set_max_delay -datapath_only (position 98). It is not recommended to override a set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint. Replace the set_clock_groups or set_false_path between clocks with point-to-point set_false_path constraints

TIMING-24#3 Warning
Overridden Max delay datapath only  
A set_clock_groups or a set_false path (see constraint position 89 in the Timing Constraints window in Vivado IDE) between clocks usb_clkout and pll_40 overrides a set_max_delay -datapath_only (position 100). It is not recommended to override a set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint. Replace the set_clock_groups or set_false_path between clocks with point-to-point set_false_path constraints
