TIMING-3#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock on Clock Modifying Block  
A primary clock Clk_320M is created on the output pin or net Clk_Gen/MMCME2_BASE_inst/CLKOUT3 of a Clock Modifying Block
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#1 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks Clk_320M and pll_40 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks Clk_320M] -to [get_clocks pll_40]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks pll_40 and Clk_320M are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks pll_40] -to [get_clocks Clk_320M]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-9#1 Warning
Unknown CDC Logic  
One or more asynchronous Clock Domain Crossing has been detected between 2 clock domains through a set_false_path or a set_clock_groups or set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint but no double-registers logic synchronizer has been found on the side of the capture clock. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-14#1 Warning
LUT on the clock tree  
The LUT usbcmdfifo_16depth_i_2 has been found on the clock tree. Run opt_design to optimize the clock trees, then re-run report_methodology. If LUT(s) are still present in the clock trees, modify the RTL or the synthesis options accordingly to move the clock gating logic to dedicated clock enable resources. Keep in mind that post-opt_design database cannot be used for pin-planning tasks
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-14#2 Warning
LUT on the clock tree  
The LUT usbcmdfifo_16depth_i_3 has been found on the clock tree. Run opt_design to optimize the clock trees, then re-run report_methodology.
